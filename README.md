# Full Adder Verilog Module

This project contains a Verilog implementation of a full adder using two half adders. A full adder is a combinational circuit that adds three input bits and generates two outputs: the sum (`s`) and the carry out (`co`).

## Code Overview

The module uses three inputs:
- `a`: First input bit.
- `b`: Second input bit.
- `cin`: Carry-in from the previous stage.

It produces two outputs:
- `s`: The sum output, representing the addition of the three input bits.
- `co`: The carry-out, indicating overflow to the next stage.

### Verilog Code:

```verilog
module fa(a, b, cin, s, co);
  input a, b, cin;
  output co, s;
  wire x1, x2, x3;

  // First half adder adds a and b
  ha w1(a, b, x1, x2);

  // Second half adder adds the carry-in to the sum of the first half adder
  ha w2(cin, x1, s, x3);

  // Carry-out is generated by OR'ing the carries from both half adders
  assign co = x2 | x3;
endmodule
```

### Functionality

- **Sum (`s`)**: The XOR operation of the three inputs `a`, `b`, and `cin` through two half adders.
- **Carry-out (`co`)**: The OR operation of the two carry outputs from the half adders.

### Explanation

This full adder uses two instances of a half adder (`ha` module):
1. The first half adder adds the bits `a` and `b`, producing a preliminary sum and carry.
2. The second half adder adds the carry-in (`cin`) and the sum from the first half adder, producing the final sum (`s`) and another carry.
3. The final carry-out (`co`) is obtained by OR'ing the two carry outputs from the half adders.

### Truth Table

| `a` | `b` | `cin` | `s` (Sum) | `co` (Carry Out) |
|-----|-----|-------|-----------|------------------|
|  0  |  0  |   0   |     0     |        0         |
|  0  |  0  |   1   |     1     |        0         |
|  0  |  1  |   0   |     1     |        0         |
|  0  |  1  |   1   |     0     |        1         |
|  1  |  0  |   0   |     1     |        0         |
|  1  |  0  |   1   |     0     |        1         |
|  1  |  1  |   0   |     0     |        1         |
|  1  |  1  |   1   |     1     |        1         |

### How to Use

1. Include the `fa` module in your Verilog project.
2. Pass the input bits `a`, `b`, and `cin` to the module.
3. The module will compute the sum (`s`) and the carry-out (`co`).

### Applications

Full adders are fundamental in the design of arithmetic circuits like:
- Ripple Carry Adders
- ALUs (Arithmetic Logic Units)
- Binary Counters
